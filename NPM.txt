This Problem is due to Having an Angular Version but not all npm packages are in support to the current version and many other deprecated functionalities.

npm install --force 

It will download all the packages with their versions from package.json and make sures it will run the project when using

npm run start

To only download specified versions packages

npm ci --force

To fix the issue once you installed all the packaage.json if any problem arsies then use

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

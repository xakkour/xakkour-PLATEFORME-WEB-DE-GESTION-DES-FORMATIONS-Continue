The covid-19 situation has forced the shift to digitization of the processes of any establishment of any type.
These digital transitions are important, to keep traceability, and efficiency. It is therefore essential for institutions to consider a digital transformation for their organization, system and processes.
In this regard, Abdelmalek Essaadi University seeks to dematerialize procedures, digitize complex administrative processes due to the following benefits: zero paper, time saving, productivity gain, optimization of operations
This report reports on this project:
The first part, will be divided into two chapters, the first chapter is reserved to give an overview on the concepts of complex administrative processes and the role of information systems to optimize them, The second chapter presents the organization of the project in terms of scoping and operational planning on the one hand.
On the other hand, the second part, we will address the practical aspect, more precisely in the first chapter modeling using the UML, by treating the diagrams of use cases and class. Then, in the second chapter, we will show the graphic aspect of the web application (graphic charter and models), and towards the end the tools used, the installation and the development result by screenshots of the interfaces
